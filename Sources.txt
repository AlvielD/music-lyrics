Some problems we faced:
- lack of information about the song writers (need for API)
- lack of accessibility of interesting functions in API without commercial plans
- matching of lyrics when some are in lower case and other in cap letters
- find a common level of granularity for the two datasets
- encoding of characters between different alphabets
- translation of paragraph headers 
- no convention between different lyrics platforms for the spelling of interjections

Languages and files we put aside in the DALI dataset:
- because of encoding problems:
    - polish (75)
    - estonian (1)
    - croatian (4)
- because of mismatch in lines breaking down between the dataset and genius:
    - portuguese : 1c1c8f03185943bd831bee5edf10f08a
    - latin (1)
- because of asian characters being written the occidental way while the real asian characters are used in Genius:
    - romanian & albanian (songs in Japanese from group, wrongly tagged as romanian and albanian)
    - 5 other songs from L'Arc~en~Ciel
    - the single song from the dataset from F(x) (a korean girlgroup)
