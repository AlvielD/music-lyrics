Some problems we faced:
- lack of information about the song writers (need for API)
- lack of accessibility of interesting functions in API without commercial plans
- matching of lyrics when some are in lower case and other in cap letters
- find a common level of granularity for the two datasets
- encoding of characters between different alphabets
- translation of paragraph headers 
- no convention between different lyrics platforms for the spelling of interjections

Languages and files we put aside in the DALI dataset:
- because of encoding problems:
    - polish (75)
    - estonian (1)
    - croatian (4)
- because of too many hyphen in the text compared to Genius:
    - latin (1)

When converting the DALI json file to the final output file enriched with Genius info, we also detect asian languages and put them aside
because of asian characters being written the occidental way while the real asian characters are used in Genius
